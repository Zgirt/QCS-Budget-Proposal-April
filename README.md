**Proposal: Request to approve the Qubic Core Services for the month of April budget proposal**

-------

Available Options:<br>
**Option 0:** No, I don’t want<br>
**Option 1:** Yes, approved the budget of  213.29 bln qubics.<br>

## Overview

**Finance through CCF donations**

QQubic Core Services (QCS) is requesting additional funding from the Computor Control Fund (CCF) to fund running costs like overhead (salaries and expenses) and to fund basic activities for Marketing, Ecosystem Development, Community Management, Strategy, Finance and Operations for the month of April. As the Qubic price decreased significantly, our previous budget was cut one month short. To reduce the impact on the CCF, we request funding for only the month of April. Any left over funds will be carried into future budgets to fund  the continued running costs.CCF currently holds 859 bn qubic and receives income of around 300bn per month. 

We are requesting $234,623 usd or 213.29 bln qubics at USD1100 / bln to fund the running costs for the month of April.<br> 

Receiving wallet address: `STRATGYZMPOAFDMOYMFPFIPWAVGCBPFODBKUCELDQANLSDOHTZYRZDEBGALE`<br>

Funds will be further distributed across ecosystem, marketing, community management and operation workgroups

## Details about the Workgroups and 2025 Strategy
We want to position Qubic as the leading decentralized AI & compute infrastructure, bridging Web3 technology with real-world applications in scientific research, AI-driven industries, and decentralized computing. We want to establish Qubic as the core execution layer for AI and compute projects, driving institutional and retail adoption while fostering a strong, engaged
community of developers, partners, and investors.<br>

This translates in 3 major objectives for QCS in 2025:<br>
- Accelerate Ecosystem Growth: Expand our community, onboard developers, and form strategic partnerships.<br>
- Achieve Innovation Leadership: Strengthen our position as the most cutting-edge blockchain in the industry.<br>
- Ensure Financial Sustainability: Establish long-term stability through strategic financial planning and revenue generation.<br>

We’ve introduced a new payments tool that tracks all incoming and outgoing payments of QCS moving forward: https://q-c-s.com/. The tool is in constant development and we welcome all feedback to further improve it.<br>

# Ecosystem Development 

## Ecosystem Growth and Developer Attraction Strategy

## Incubation & Grants Progress

In the last quarter of last year, we attracted the first incubation projects, such as Vottun, Nostromo, and Qubex. Additionally, grants were approved, enabling the development of new tools and utilities for developers, including projects from the last batch like Onyze, QEarn, Qatum, and Qxboard.

### Grants Overview
- 5 Total Grants projects
- 7 Projects 100% delivered
- 5 Projects approx. 70% developed
- 1 Project Blocked
- 2 Projects on hold

#### Execution & Funding:
✅ 75% Total execution  
✅ $114.7K funded  
✅ $34.2K pending  

### Incubation Overview
- 5 Total Incubation projects + 1 audit already delivered
- 1 Project approx. 90% developed
- 4 Projects approx. 50% developed

#### Execution & Funding:
✅ 65% Total execution  
✅ $128K funded  
✅ $150K pending  

The grants and incubation programs already have their own funding, and this budget allocation will not expand these funds. Current expenses can be viewed in the following spreadsheets:
- **Grants:** [View Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zvda8WZzVljbu6LKMxdTnNlt2Fj5T65xlH6FSOvO33k/edit?usp=sharing)
- **Incubation:** [View Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ncuM_LT8HFMuD5D7FXHGrXITACNgD2W17FZqxygz58A/edit?usp=sharing)

Currently, they have a treasury, after deducting the payments for pending milestones once completed, of 12.3B and 78.5B for grants and incubation, respectively. This treasury is only used to pay for grants and incubation projects. Due to the drop in QUBIC’s price, the costs for grants and incubation have increased significantly. For this reason, we will use part of the remaining KOL funds to fill the grants fund.

During Q1, we did not onboard new incubation teams, as we focused on improving project onboarding processes. We identified bottlenecks and are actively working on solutions, including internally developing online IDEs, streamlining smart contract deployment processes in collaboration with Core-Tech and developing smart contracts for incubation projects.

## Event Strategy & Global Presence
- Presence in key events in the US
- MAD HACK 2025 is about to take place with institutional support
- In April, our scientists will attend ICLR in Singapore, providing exposure for Aigarth’s advancements at the most important AI conference

## Operational Improvements & Team Growth
- We have developed **q-c-s.com**, allowing tracking of all payments, eliminating the need for spreadsheets
- A **Project Manager** has been onboarded, laying the foundation for a PMO to scale as the number of projects grows
- Hiring a representative for Asia is still pending

## Q2 Budget Allocation Priorities
- Continuing the event strategy and increasing global presence
- Further development of libraries and utilities to attract more entrepreneurs to Qubic

Ecosystem expenses are allocated for team salaries, market makers, the T2 US listing, events, scientific team, and associated costs for the mentioned operations. It is not included in the budget costs to list in T1 exchanges.
